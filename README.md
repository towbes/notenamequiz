# notenamequiz
A quiz for reading Treble + Bass clef notes to practice piano sight reading

## To Do
1. ~~Add a command line options for debug level~~
2. ~~Add a debug print function that allows different print statements based on the command line option passed~~
3. Handle user selection to start a quiz game
4. Implement printing of the musical notes. Should this be a ~ 8x8 slice where music notes can be slotted in at different points?  Is is possible to draw a note on a line in ascii?  Might be better to go ahead and just implement GUI, this looks nice: https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne
